# Product-Management-Web

This project is a web-based product management system developed using React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend.

## Frontend

The frontend is built with React, utilizing Vite for an optimized development experience. It provides a dynamic user interface for managing products.

### Getting Started with the Frontend

To get started with the frontend, navigate to the `Ecom-frontend` directory:

```sh
cd Ecom-frontend
```

Install the dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

To run the frontend locally:
```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start the React application on a local development server, typically accessible at http://localhost:5135.



## Backend

The backend is developed with Spring Boot, offering RESTful APIs to interact with the product management system. It uses an in-memory H2 database for data persistence.

Getting Started with the Backend
To get started with the backend, navigate to the Ecom-backend directory:

```sh
cd Ecom-backend
```

To run the backend application, you can use the Maven wrapper included in the project:
```sh
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

This will start the Spring Boot application. The RESTful APIs will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.
